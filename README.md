Atmospheric Volumetric Fog/Lights for Unity URP

Aether provides atmospheric volumetric fog and lighting effects to the Unity Universal Render Pipeline.

This project allows developers to easily create immersive and realistic atmospheric conditions in their games, such as fog, mist, and haze, which can significantly enhance the overall aesthetic of a scene.

# Fork Notes (lordofduct)

This fork exists to cleanup some issues with the original version and add a scaling proximity node system for tweaking the 'global' fog settings to the specifications of my partner.

The original project does not define a specific license but language of the original developer suggests it's for public use. If you have any questions in regards to the lack of a license attached, speak to them.
